### Feedback Analysis and Improvement

#### Analysis
**Clarity and Specificity:**
- The feedback has a good amount of detailed information, but it is lengthy and somewhat convoluted.
- There are multiple points and views which may dilute the core message.
- It is difficult to discern actionable steps from the feedback.

**Actionability:**
- The feedback proposes a discussion but does not provide a concrete plan for how or when to have this discussion.
- The use of subjective language like "I believe" and "my opinion" without specific examples or data reduces the persuasiveness.
- Suggestions are present, but they aren't clearly separated from the main text making them hard to extract.

**Positivity and Constructiveness:**
- The feedback is mostly positive about the existing work but turns cautionary on future implementations.
- It lacks clear, actionable steps for improvement or alternative workflows.

**Ranking:**
On a scale of 1-10, I would rank this feedback at around **5**. This is because it provides useful insights but falls short in terms of clarity, actionability, and structured suggestions for the future.

### Improved Feedback
To make the feedback more actionable, consider the following improvements:

1. **Summarize the Key Points Upfront:**
   Start with a brief summary.

2. **Break Down the Feedback:**
   Structure it into sections with clear headings.

3. **Be Specific:**
   Use bullet points or numbered lists for suggestions.

4. **Set Next Steps:**
   Clearly define what should happen next.

5. **Remove Redundancies:**
   Eliminate verbosity and ensure conciseness.

### Improved Feedback Example

---

#### Summary:
The PR is well-done, but our current workflow for using LookML Dashboards in updates is problematic. A discussion is needed to optimize our approach.

---

#### Detailed Feedback:

**Current PR Evaluation:**
- The file is clean and ready for deployment.
- Testing in development mode on Looker confirmed functionality.

**Concerns for Future Workflow:**
- **Maintainability:**
  - LookML Dashboard seems almost correctly used, but future updates (e.g., adding dimensions/tiles) are not maintainable through this method.
  - Looker is designed to leverage User-Defined features in explores.

**Recommended Actions:**
- **Evaluate Workflow:**
  - Follow guidance from Guilherme: deploy dashboard once ready and explore changing sources in production.
  
- **Discussion Points:**
  - Should we convert the code to a User-Defined dashboard to streamline future updates?
  - Evaluate when LookML Dashboard is necessary, considering business adaptability.

**Pros and Cons:**
- **Pros:**
  - Version control on dashboards.
  - More robust and powerful feature utilization.
  
- **Cons:**
  - Complicated minor updates.
  - Overhead in case of dynamic changes like date selections.
  
**Next Steps:**
1. **Team Discussion:**
   - Schedule a meeting to discuss the pros and cons of LookML Dashboards vs. User-Defined dashboards.
   - Define criteria for when to use each type of dashboard.
2. **Action Items Post-Meeting:**
   - Document agreed workflow.
   - Provide training on the adopted approach if needed.

**Conclusion:**
Decide as a team on the most efficient and adaptable dashboard implementation strategy to enhance our workflow and maintainability.
